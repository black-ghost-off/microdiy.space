# Website Analytics

Now, Dream only support [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/).

In `hugo.toml`, set:

```toml
[services]
[services.googleAnalytics]
ID = '...'

```

<Callout type="warning">
You may have used `googleAnalytics = "..."` before. This is deprecated in Hugo `0.120.0`.

Please upgrade to the new configuration. See https://gohugo.io/methods/site/googleanalytics/ for more details.
